# Idiots-Delight-Solitaire-
Windows Desktop Solitaire game (but not the one everyone knows). 

The game starts with one rows of cards already dealt.

The top most card of each row is the active card. When there are two or more cards of the same suit, if you click on the lesser card, it is removed. Card values go from 2-A. Once a root level spot is open, you may drag another card to that spot. 

The game is won when the only row remaining is the 4 aces and all cards have been dealt.
